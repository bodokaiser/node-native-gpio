# node-native-gpio

**node-native-gpio** is a sysfs **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput **O**utput 
wrapper for node.js. It gives you the ability to control GPIO devices in a 
simple object orientated manner.

## Installation

Install **node-native-gpio** with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install node-native-gpio

## Preview

    var gpio = require('native-gpio');

    var gpio22 = new gpio.GPIO(22);

    gpio22.direction(gpio.OUT)
          .value(gpio.HIGH)
          .value(gpio.LOW)
          .value(gpio.HIGH);

## Documentation

### Constants

To ensure safe execution **node-native-gpio** relays on some constants.

#### IN

Direction constant used to determinate that our GPIO device listens for 
incoming signals. While a device is set to `IN` we can only read and not write 
to it.

#### OUT

Direction constant used to determinate that our GPIO device writes outgoing
signals. While a device is set to `OUT` we can read and set the current value.

#### LOW

Value constant for off state of a GPIO device.

#### HIGH

Value constant for on state of a GPIO device.

### Class: GPIO 

#### new GPIO(pin)

#### gpio.value([value])

#### gpio.direction([value])
