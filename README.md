# node-native-gpio

**node-native-gpio** is a sysfs **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput **O**utput 
wrapper for node.js. It gives you the ability to control GPIO devices in a 
simple object orientated manner.

## Installation

Install **node-native-gpio** with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install node-native-gpio

## Preview

    var gpio = require('native-gpio');

    var gpio22 = new gpio.GPIO(22);

    gpio22.direction(gpio.OUT)
          .value(gpio.HIGH)
          .value(gpio.LOW)
          .value(gpio.HIGH);

## Documentation

### Class: GPIO 

The `GPIO` function prototype is a C++ add-on which abstracts a GPIO device as
instancable object. There are some class constants defined which should be used
for setting values (see below).

#### GPIO.IN

Direction constant used to determinate that our GPIO device listens for 
incoming signals. While a device is set to `IN` we can only read and not write 
to it.

#### GPIO.OUT

Direction constant used to determinate that our GPIO device writes outgoing
signals. While a device is set to `OUT` we can read and set the current value.

#### GPIO.LOW

Value constant for off state of a GPIO device.

#### GPIO.HIGH

Value constant for on state of a GPIO device.

#### new GPIO(id)

    var gpio36 = new GPIO(36);

Creates a new instance of the GPIO class. Internally it will do a GPIO export
if neccessary and open the GPIO's value and direction file descriptor to 
reduce syscalls. The C++ deconstructor ensures that the file descriptors are 
closed and the GPIO device is getting unexported (this would not have been
possible with plain JavaScript).

#### gpio.direction([value])

    if (gpio36.direction() == GPIO.OUT)
        gpio36.direction(GPIO.IN);

Returns the current GPIO direction mode if no arguments supplied else it will
check if the first argument is a valid constant and then will set this as
GPIO direction.

#### gpio.value([value])

    while (gpio36.value() != GPIO.HIGH)
        // wait until GPIO value changes to HIGH

    // use GPIO as output device
    gpio36.direction(GPIO.OUT).value(GPIO.LOW);

Returns the current GPIO value if no arguments supplied else it will check if
the first argument is a valid constant and then will use this as GPIO value.
